Realtime bridge: Chatwoot conversation activity -> frappe.publish_realtime.

## Why polling, not a persistent ActionCable connection

The research doc (chatwoot_api_reference.md, section 3) confirms Chatwoot
exposes an ActionCable WebSocket (`wss://.../cable`) that an external client
can subscribe to with the service agent's `pubsub_token`, receiving
`message.created` / `conversation.status_changed` events account-wide. That
is the architecturally "best" way to get near-real-time updates without
polling REST.

However, that requires a LONG-LIVED process holding one open WebSocket
connection for the app's entire lifetime — distinct from anything Frappe's
own process model runs today:
  - `bench worker` processes (RQ workers) are short-task consumers, not
    designed to hold a single persistent external connection for their
    entire lifetime; doing so would tie up a whole worker slot indefinitely
    and doesn't survive a `bench restart`/deploy cycle without explicit
    reconnect-supervision logic.
  - This deployment is Docker/Dokploy-managed (see ampere-server-inventory /
    dokploy-monorepo-webhook-drops-apps in memory) with a fixed docker-compose
    service topology (web/socketio/worker/scheduler/db/redis containers).
    Adding a NEW standalone service (a small always-on Python process just to
    hold the ActionCable connection) is possible but is a docker-compose /
    apps.json-adjacent infrastructure change outside what a Frappe app's own
    install can provision — it would need a matching change to the CRM
    compose's docker-compose.yml, reviewed and deployed independently of this
    app's code.
  - Frappe's own scheduler (`bench schedule`) already runs a supervised,
    auto-restarting periodic-job loop with no additional infra — cron-style
    entries in hooks.py are picked up automatically once this app is
    installed, no compose changes needed.

Given the user's explicit prior guidance (`infra-cold-start-race-class`,
`wallet-service-audit-ctx-cancel` in memory) to be wary of long-lived
goroutines/processes capturing stale context and needing careful
supervision, and given Chatwoot's own confirmed absence of rate-limit
headers (so a cheap, low-frequency poll costs it nothing), the pragmatic
choice for a first, deployable-today version is:

    A once-a-minute scheduler_event poll of the conversations list,
    diffed against the last-seen (id -> updated_at) snapshot in
    frappe.cache(), firing frappe.publish_realtime("chatwoot_message", ...)
    for every conversation whose updated_at advanced.

This is explicitly a fallback, not the final word: `poll_and_broadcast`
below is written so that swapping in a real persistent ActionCable listener
later (as a proper standalone worker process, once a compose-level change is
approved) only requires replacing what CALLS `_broadcast_conversation_update`
— the broadcast contract and payload shape stay identical, so no CRM/FE
consumer code would need to change on that upgrade.

## Broadcast contract

Event name: "chatwoot_message"
Payload: {"conversation_id": int, "inbox_id": int, "updated_at": int}

Deliberately minimal (IDs + timestamp only, no message body) — mirrors
frappe_whatsapp/CRM's own pattern (see frappe_whatsapp_pattern.md section 3):
the realtime event is a "go refetch" signal, not the data itself. The
frontend re-queries `frappe_chatwoot.frappe_chatwoot.api.chatwoot.get_messages` (the live,
authoritative source) rather than trusting anything carried on the socket.
Site-wide fan-out (no user/room scoping), same documented-intentional
pattern as frappe_whatsapp's own webhook.py and CRM's WhatsApp on_update
hook — clients filter client-side by conversation/reference match.
